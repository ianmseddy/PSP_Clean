Notes re: PSP and TSP data

Alberta:
OrigPlotID1 = GroupNumber, OrigPlotID2 = PlotNumber  #MeasureID is created by Yong from unique Group/Plot/Year combinations
OrigPlotID1 is numeric and has been renamed to have the prefix AB to distinguish it from other PSP data. 
GIS data is only specific to GroupNumber. This means there are multiple entries that share same location, because GIS data has MeasureID column (unique to Plot).
MeasureID is unique to PlotNumber so that individual trees are tracked, otherwise treeNumbers would overlap withins same 'Group'. 
The actual number of unique locations is HeaderData[, .N, (OrigPlotID1, MeasureYear)] = 2033

treeNumber 9999 is in Alberta. 5% of data is NA still. Perhaps we want to keep this for estimating biomass in an area? 

BC: Uses a composite key with plotNumber and groupNumber. Have not found any mistakes but missing huge area of province

Saskatchewan:
tspSKMistic: does not OrigPlotID2 or equivalent. 
Had to remove trees with treeNumber 0 (150/96,000) Perhaps we want to keep this for estimating biomass in an area? 
There are duplicate locations but this is because 'STAND' is used to generate the MeasureID, even though many stands share the same location. 

Sk:Does not use OrigPlotID2 or equivalent
OrigPlotID1 is numeric and has been renamed to have the prefix SK to distinguish it from other PSP data


NFI: 
data has no repeat measurements.
